Here is a .env-sample file specifically tailored for integrating GitHub Runners with your repository. This configuration includes placeholders for the necessary environment variables to set up and manage GitHub Runners.

```markdown
# Environment configuration for GitHub Runners integration

# GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) for authenticating with the GitHub API
# Get your PAT token from: https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta
GITHUB_TOKEN="github_pat_****"

# GitHub repository owner (e.g., your GitHub username or organization name)
GITHUB_OWNER="your_github_owner"

# GitHub repository name where the runners will be integrated
GITHUB_REPO="your_repository_name"

# GitHub Runner labels (comma-separated) to identify the runner's purpose
RUNNER_LABELS="self-hosted,linux,x64"

# GitHub Runner name (unique identifier for the runner)
RUNNER_NAME="your_runner_name"

# GitHub Runner working directory (where the runner will execute jobs)
RUNNER_WORK_DIR="/home/github-runner"

# GitHub Runner registration token (retrieved from the repository settings)
# Generate this token from: https://github.com/your_github_owner/your_repository_name/settings/actions/runners
RUNNER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN="your_runner_registration_token"

# GitHub API URL (default is https://api.github.com, modify for GitHub Enterprise)
GITHUB_API_URL="https://api.github.com"

# Optional: Proxy settings for the runner (if required)
HTTP_PROXY=""
HTTPS_PROXY=""
NO_PROXY=""

# Optional: Log level for the runner (e.g., debug, info, warn, error)
RUNNER_LOG_LEVEL="info"
```

### Explanation of Variables:
1. **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**: Used to authenticate with the GitHub API for managing runners.
2. **`GITHUB_OWNER`**: Specifies the owner of the repository (user or organization).
3. **`GITHUB_REPO`**: The name of the repository where the runner will be integrated.
4. **`RUNNER_LABELS`**: Labels to categorize the runner (e.g., OS, architecture, or custom tags).
5. **`RUNNER_NAME`**: A unique name for the runner to identify it in the GitHub Actions interface.
6. **`RUNNER_WORK_DIR`**: The directory where the runner will execute jobs.
7. **`RUNNER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN`**: Token required to register the runner with the repository.
8. **`GITHUB_API_URL`**: The API endpoint for GitHub (default is for GitHub.com; modify for GitHub Enterprise).
9. **Proxy Settings**: Optional variables for configuring HTTP/HTTPS proxies if needed.
10. **`RUNNER_LOG_LEVEL`**: Sets the verbosity of logs generated by the runner.

### Usage:
1. Replace the placeholder values (`your_*`) with actual values specific to your GitHub repository and runner setup.
2. Save this file as `.env` in your project directory.
3. Use this configuration in your runner setup scripts or tools to automate the integration process.

GitHub Runner Tool
-------------------
This script automates the integration of GitHub Runners with a repository.
It handles runner registration, configuration, and management using the GitHub API.

Dependencies:
- requests (Install via `pip install requests`)

Development Debt:
- Ensure proper error handling for API requests.
- Add support for GitHub Enterprise if needed.
